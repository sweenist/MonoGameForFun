# Reflections on the Game Dev Process to date
*July 26,2020*

## Preamble

My day job finds me in a .NET codebase using C#. I've been in an infrastructure
and DevOps role for the last year so my labors find me in more
of configuration and deployment rather than pounding out features with code.

I am an engineer and a n artistic type. I get the itch to create now and again
and I always come back to "making a game". I could fall back on my defaults
for game making which include python and pygame. I *could* do that but
what would I learn that could help me be a better engineer? I would certainly
learn some things but I want to work in a tangent space with the ecosystem
I use at work. 

## Enter: MonoGame

A friend of mine mentioned MonoGame to me a couple months ago. I've used XNA
briefly and I was intrigued. I decided that I would like to use Visual Studio
Code exclusively as my IDE. I use Visual Studio with ReSharper at work but it
feels a bit heavy and resource heavy. 

I also wanted to try out a different test framework for unit tests. I use
NUnit and Moq at work. I have never used xUnit. Let's see what that's about!

I use GitExtensions pretty heavily at work. I have teammates that use command 
line git. When answering their "how do I _______ in git?" I often cannot
articulate what to do in the command line. I'm taking this time to work my
repository purely from the command line. I must say, `git add -i` has been
pretty fun!

So I'm using MonoGame and it's going pretty well. There are a few gotchas
to work around like having certain Runtimes so font rendering will work.

## Balancing Engineering Practices and Turd Polishing

As I've delved into MonoGame and making an old timey, top down RPG, I am
never quite sure how to balance progress with reworking and refactoring code.
I effectively have the same thing to show for the last couple weeks but I've
implemented and reimplemented a screen and input management system. I'm living
in a Sisyphus effect right now. Is the refactoring sensible right now? Maybe. 
The shapes and interactions of things in the code base make a bit more sense
right now. This process could have gone a bit faster with someone to collaborate
with or a rubber duck. I've spent a fair bit of time pacing the house and
talking through design decisions and problem spaces

Overall, I'm enjoying the process. It's good to audit my decision making process
and evaluate what is important for right now. It's been a lot like rearranging
a room but it looks like it will be pretty easy to add new entities and
capabilities.
