# MonoGameForFun
I just wanted to play around with MonoGame. Historically, I've started a bunch of games in python with the pygame library.
I live in C# code by day (mostly) and thought I'd venture on my own and use this as an exercise to apply some good coding practices. 

Really, not much to see here. Will this project die like the others? Maybe.
