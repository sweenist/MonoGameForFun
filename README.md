# MonoGameForFun
I just wanted to play around with MonoGame. Historically, I've started a bunch of games in python with the pygame library.
I live in C# code by day (mostly) and thought I'd venture on my own and use this as an exercise to apply some good coding practices. 

Really, not much to see here. Will this project die like the others? Maybe. 


## Problems and Solutions

### Sprite Fonts won't compile -> missing freetyp6.dll

> Installing the 2012 C++ x64 redistributable solved this problem https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679
